            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                It's not pining, it's passed on! This parrot is no more! It has ceased to be! 
                It's expired and gone to meet its maker! This is a late parrot! 
                It's a stiff! Bereft of life, it rests in peace! 
                If you hadn't nailed it to the perch, it would be pushing up the daisies! 
                It's metabolic processes are now history! 
                He's off the twig! 
                He's kicked the bucket, he's shuffled off the mortal coil, rung down the curtain and joined the choir invisible. This is an ex-parrot! 
                The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. 
                THAT is why I am your king. 
                Oh, king eh? Very nice. 
                And how'd you get that, eh? 
                By exploiting the workers. 
                By hanging on to outdated imperialist dogma which perpetuates the economic and social differences in our society.
